# post-sample-app

The app list the posts consumed by the JSON API JSONPlaceholder where it shows details of every post and allows you to set posts as favorites.

To run the app it is required to run pod install in order to install the required libraries of the project, then select a device to run the app and run.

The main architecture used in this project is MVVM (Model - View - Model View) because it is the one that best suits the iOS mobile apps architectures, also, I find it very clean and orderly, allowing the development of the different modules in a simpler way.

The libraries used in this project where AlamoFire, CoreData and SwiftyJSON to allow processing the data obtained from the api in a simpler and more efficient way.
